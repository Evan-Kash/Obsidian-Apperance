# Obsidian Vault Configuration

## Overview

Obsidian creates a hidden `.obsidian` configuration folder in the root directory of your vault. This folder stores preferences specific to your vault, including:

- **Hotkeys**
- **Themes**
- **Community Plugins**

## Accessing the .obsidian Folder

By default, many operating systems hide folders that start with a period (`.`). To view the `.obsidian` folder, you may need to adjust your file manager's settings.

### Steps to Show Hidden Folders:

- **Windows**:
  1. Open File Explorer.
  2. Click on the "View" tab.
  3. Check the "Hidden items" box.

- **macOS**:
  1. Open Finder.
  2. Press `Cmd + Shift + .` (the period key).

- **Linux**:
  1. Open your file manager.
  2. Press `Ctrl + H` to toggle hidden files.
